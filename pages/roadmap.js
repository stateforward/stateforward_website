            Most of the Python functionality is operational. However, while developing the TypeScript library, I recognized that it would be more logical to first develop the Rust library and subsequently transition both the Python and JavaScript libraries to utilize the Rust library for backend operations. This approach will ensure a more uniform and efficient codebase across all languages. Therefore, our current efforts are concentrated on developing the Rust library. Unless significant issues arise with integrating the Rust library into the Python and JavaScript environments, we will proceed with transitioning these libraries to use the Rust backend.
